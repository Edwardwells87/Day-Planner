## Technologies Used

* I utilized VS Code to make the majority of this project

## Description
This is a simple day planner. You can write out your plans and save the information. It will be there when you come back. It also tells the time by the minute. Still not sure about this time thing? Thats alright, the day planner has soft colors on its timeblocks to keep you on track. 


## Deployment and Use

This is the second application that has given me trouble with commits and pushes but it seems to be running fine with no errors. This application was designed for a coding project. Its original repository can be found below.
